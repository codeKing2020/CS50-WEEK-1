First ask how much the cashier owes the customer
    If not a float, re-prompt -  check
Convert to integer and round off - check
Take integer and ask 
    If I take away 25c, will there be any left over?
        If yes, take away, record take, then try again to check
    Else if I take away 10c, will there be any left over?
        If yes, take away, record take, then check again
    Else if I take away 5c, will there be any left over?
        If yes, take away, record take, then check again
    Else take away 1c
        Record take
Then print value, ending with an integer and \n

Should be loop to check until its is zero. * Maybe might not be needed
Conditionals should also be looped to check if we can still take big bites
Input should be decimal, so use get_float
